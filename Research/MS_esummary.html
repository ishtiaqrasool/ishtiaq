        <h1>Acoustic diagnosis of defects in circular pipes</h1><br>

        My present research is to devise a method based on the acoustic signal
        processing for the detection and location of small defects in a long circular pipe. The defects in the pipes are
        usually formed due to corrosion and the forehand information about their formation may prevent the major
        accidents in the industry. I have carried out some experiments in the lab which have given much satisfactory
        results, and based on these results I have already sent a manuscript for the publication in an international
        journal. I will also present some results in a conference in Hokkaido University in February 1998. The summary
        of the basic idea of detection method and some of the results are given below.

        <br><br>
        <h2>The basic idea for detection:</h2><br>

        A Maximum length linear feedback shift register sequence (M-sequence) is transmitted at an end of a defective
        pipe. A receiver placed at the same end of the pipe will receive the actual sequence and some replica of the
        sequences reflected back from the far end as well as the defects, if they exist, in the pipe. As the auto
        correlation function (ACR) of the M-sequence is a quasi impulse, the cross correlation function (CCF) of
        received and the transmitted sequences will give pulses corresponding to the direct pulse and each replica of
        the M-sequence. The distance of a reflection pulse from the main pulse gives the distance of the reflecting
        object from the end of the pipe.<br><br>
        The noise will have no effect if it is uncorrelated with the sequence.
        However certain kind of noise, mainly due to the reflections from the surrounding objects and the limitations of
        the measuring system, make it difficult to distinguish between the pulses due to the reflections from the
        defects (wanted pulses) and the pulses due to noise (unwanted pulses). Certain noise reduction techniques are
        applied to reduce the noise and identify the wanted peaks from the unwanted peaks.

        <br><br>
        <h2>S/N Improvement:</h2><br>

        It is proved to be useful to take data using a pipe having no defect and the identical dimensions as those of
        the defective pipe, and subtract it from the data taken with defective pipe before applying other noise
        reduction techniques. Another useful technique is taking the moving average of the data. It makes the data
        smoother by taking the weighted average of the neighboring data points, and tends to remove the noise pulses of
        small width. Inverse filtering is another technique based on linear prediction, which can be used to remove
        certain kind of noise from the signal. Levinson's recursion is an efficient algorithm for constructing a filter
        based on AR model. The filter constructed from a part of the CCF, which does not contain any reflections from
        the defects, and comprises only of the noise removes the predictable type of noise like the sinusoidal ripple
        etc.<br><br>
        In addition to the noise reduction techniques described above, a new
        coincidence enhancement technique is devised which will remove all kinds of unwanted pulses on the CCF, and
        enhance the wanted pulses. At first the data is taken by placing the transmitter and receiver at one end of the
        pipe and its CCF is calculated. Then data is taken from the other end of the pipe and its CCF is calculated.
        This data is reversed, i.e., the ith point is interchanged with (n-i)th point. In this way the wanted peaks will
        be at the same location on the two CCF's, and the unwanted peaks will be at different locations. Now if the two
        CCF's are multiplied, every wanted peak will be enhanced by multiplying with itself, and the unwanted peaks will
        be removed by multiplying with the minimum of the CCF, which must have a value equal to zero ideally.

        <br><br>
        <h2>The Experiments:</h2><br>

        For all the experiments, the M-sequence generated by 11 bit shift register is transmitted at a frequency of 20
        kHz, and the received signal is sampled at a frequency of 80 kHz using a PC with the supervisory routine written
        in C++.
        An experiment was done on a 2 m long pipe having an inner diameter of
        2 cm and outer diameter of 1 inch, and having 3 holes in it, a 1 mm hole at 9.5 cm, a 1.3 mm hole at 97 cm, and
        a 1.5 mm hole at 135 cm from the transmitting end. All the holes were easily detectable and the size of the
        pulses on the CCF gave the information of the size of the holes as well. A 2nd experiment was done on a pipe of
        length 77 cm, and having about 11 defects in it of different shapes and sizes. Some of the defects were very
        close to each other. It was observed that the defects which are about 5 cm apart can be distinguished from each
        other. A 3rd experiment done on a 4 m pipe showed that a very small hole of the order of 1 mm is detectable
        anywhere in this pipe.<br>

        <br><br>
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2><br>

        The method can be applied to detect the holes of the order 1 mm anywhere in a 4 m long pipe, and can distinguish
        between the two defects if they are more than 5 cm apart from each other. The method is not applied yet on more
        longer pipes.
