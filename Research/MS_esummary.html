        <h1>Acoustic diagnosis of defects in circular pipes</h1><br>

        Forehand information of the formation of defects in the pipes (for example, due to corrosion) may prevent major accidents in the industry. In this research, I developed a prototype that can perform this task satisfactorily without requiring the industry to shut down for inspection.

        <br><br>
        <h2>The System</h2><br>

        A Maximum length linear feedback shift register sequence (M-sequence) is transmitted at one end of the pipe. A receiver placed at the same end receives the actual sequence along with its replicas reflected from the far end and defects if they exist in the pipe. As the M-sequence’s autocorrelation function (ACR) is a quasi-impulse, the cross-correlation function (CCF) of received and the transmitted sequences will give pulses corresponding to the direct pulse and each reflection of the M-sequence. The distance of each pulse from the strongest direct pulse will give the distance of the object that reflected it. The noise will have no effect if it is uncorrelated with the sequence. However, certain kinds of noise, mainly due to the reflections from the surrounding objects and the limitations of the measuring system, make it difficult to distinguish between the pulses due to the reflections from the defects (wanted pulses) and the pulses due to noise (unwanted pulses). 

        <br><br>
        <h2>S/N Improvement</h2><br>

        The first step is to subtract the signal obtained for a pipe having no defect from the signal received for the defective pipe before applying other noise reduction techniques. Next, we calculate the moving average of the signal by taking the weighted sum of the neighboring points to remove the noise pulses of small width. This is followed by applying the inverse filtering technique based on linear prediction. Levinson’s recursion is an efficient algorithm for constructing a filter based on an auto-regression model. The filter constructed from a part of CCF, which does not contain any reflections from the defects and comprises only the noise, is used to remove the predictable noise like the sinusoidal ripple.
        <br><br>
        In addition, a new technique referred to as “coincidence enhancement” is devised, which suppresses all unwanted pulses on the CCF and enhances the pulses caused by defects. At first, the data is taken by placing the transmitter and receiver at one end of the pipe and its CCF is calculated. Then data is taken from the other end of the pipe, and its CCF is calculated. This second data is reversed in the spatial domain, i.e., the ith point is swapped with (n-i)th point. In this way, the wanted peaks get at the same location on the two CCFs, but the unwanted peaks remain at different locations. Now, if the two CCFs are multiplied, every wanted peak will be enhanced by multiplying with itself, and the unwanted peaks will be removed by multiplying with zero.

        <h2>Experiments</h2><br>

        For all experiments, the M-sequence generated by 11-bit shift register was transmitted at 20 kHz frequency, and the received signal was sampled at 80 kHz frequency. A code written in C was used to interface with the transmitter and the receiver. 
        <br><br>
        The first experiment was done on a 2 m long pipe having an inner diameter of 2 cm, outer diameter of 1 inch, and three holes in the wall – a 1 mm hole at 9.5 cm, a 1.3 mm hole at 97 cm, and a 1.5 mm hole at 135 cm from the transmitting end. All the holes were easily detectable, and the size of pulses on CCF gave information on the holes’ size. A 2nd experiment was done on a pipe of 77 cm length, provided by our industry partner, having about 11 defects of different shapes and sizes. Some of the defects were very close to each other. It was observed that the defects about 5 cm apart could be distinguished from each other using our algorithm. A 3rd experiment done on a 4 m pipe showed that a tiny hole of the order of 1 mm is detectable anywhere in this pipe.

        <br><br>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2><br>

        The method can be applied to detect the holes of the order 1 mm anywhere in a 4 m long pipe and can distinguish between the two defects if they are more than 5 cm apart from each other.
