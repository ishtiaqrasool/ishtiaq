    <h1>Mixed Reality Clothing, A*STAR, Singapore</h1>
    <b>Members: </b>b>Ishtiaq Rasool Khan (PI), Mialolong Yuan, Arthur Niswar, Farzam Farbiz (Program Manager)<br>
    Funding: I2R A*STAR Singapore (500,000 SGD)
    Status: Completed
    <br><br>

    After the release of Microsoft Kinect, there was a renewed interest in mixed reality applications. I submitted a
    proposal for virtual try-on of apparel, which was awarded a funding of more than 500K SGD. This was
    multi-disciplinary research to develop a prototype of a virtual mirror, in front of which the user could see him/her
    wearing different clothes. The following modules were researched and developed:

    <ol type="a">

        <li>setting up the virtual mirror (a display system), which would look exactly like a real mirror</li>
        <li>automatic measurement of the user’s body dimensions</li>
        <li>customizing the 3D models of clothes to the user’s body</li>
        <li>capturing user’s movements</li>
        <li>animating clothes mesh in real-time</li>
        <li>providing a gesture-controlled interface for selection of clothes from the wardrobe</li>
    </ol>
    Modules a, b, c, d, and f heavily relied on computer vision techniques and required real-time operation.<br>

    <h2>My role:</h2><br>
    I worked as PI of this project during the research and commercialization phases. I looked over the development of
    different modules for four years by a team of 8 PhD researchers and a few engineers. I was also responsible for
    meeting up with the industry representatives and demonstrate the technology.<br>

    <h2>Commercialization: </h2><br>
    project received an additional highly competitive grant of 300 K SGD by ETPL, the commercial wing of A*STAR. The
    technology was licensed to a local company to develop the commercial product. A physical mirror comprising a large
    display, a GPU, and required software was developed and demonstrated at various locations such as metro stations,
    exhibits, and shopping malls. Fashion brands such as Triumph and the famous Japanese shopping mall in Singapore,
    PARCO Next Next, partnered with us. PARCO set-up our system in its incubator of new fashion designers.<br>

    <h2>Add-ons:</h2><br>
    A feature was added in the commercial product to capture a photo in a virtual dress and post it on Facebook.
    Facebook friends could give their feedback to the user’s new look and recommend the project. Besides dresses, a new
    collection of virtual accessories such as bags, watches, jewelry, and glasses were also included for virtual try on.
    A feature was added to show the people passing by the store in different apparel to attract and encourage them to
    visit the store.<br>

    <h2>Spin-Off: </h2><br>
    After the project completion, we received a 5-years funding to spinoff a company. My program manager took the
    initiative and started up a new company, AYNE, which drew good interest and investment particularly from China. AYNE
    won the silver prize for Best Innovative Infocomm Product (Immersive Media) at the SiTF (Singapore Infocomm
    Technology Federation) Awards 2017. The technology was customized for mobile users and an app iTRY was launched by
    AYNE.<br>
