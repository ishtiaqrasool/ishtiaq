    <h1>Taylor series based designs of linear phase non-recursice
        FIR digital filters</h1>

    <p>
        With the invention of digital computer and emergence of Shannon sampling theorem to
        reconstruct continuous signals from their discrete time samples, digital signals are
        generally preferred over analog signals. The major advantages of digital signals over
        analog signals include better storage (floppies, hard disks, CDs etc), duplication
        without degradation and the ease of transmission from one place to other
        (like wireless communication and transmission of data through Internet etc).
        Due to these factors, digital signals have replaced analog signals in most of the daily
        life applications (like telephony) and are expected to replace in the others
        (like televisions) in the near future. This makes the digital signal processing one of
        the most active research fields among all the engineering disciplines.
        Some of the advantages, which digital systems offer over their analog counterparts are high accuracy and
        reliability,
        smaller size, uncritical component tolerances, no influence of component drifts and spurious environmental
        signals and the
        ease with which circuit parameters can be changed. <br><br>

        Digital filtering, an important tool in digital signal processing (DSP), is in general a process to amplify,
        attenuate,
        isolate or manipulate certain components in the spectrum of a signal according to some desired specifications.
        The uses of
        the digital filters are multifold, e.g., noise removal, separation of mixed signals, demodulation and band
        limiting etc.
        Various designs of digital filters are available in literature, ranging from the simple (but inaccurate) windows
        based
        designs to the most sophisticated Chebyshev designs. In general, the main criterion to evaluate the performance
        of digital
        filters is the accuracy, with which its frequency response meets the desired specifications. However in real
        time
        applications, the more emphasis is placed on the efficiency, which includes the processing time and the required
        storage.
        Unfortunately most of the present designs, somehow, do not meet both of these criteria simultaneously. My Ph.D.
        research
        is about to develop some new designs of digital filters, which are more accurate than the available ones and are
        efficient
        enough to be used in real time systems. First chapter of my Ph.D. thesis collects some basic concepts of
        filtering and
        briefly describes some of the available design techniques. <br><br>

        A classical example of digital filtering is numerical differentiation, which uses the equally spaced samples of
        the input
        signal to evaluate the rate of its change. Numerical differentiation is performed using finite difference
        approximations
        of the derivatives based on Taylor series. However these approximations could never be implemented as digital
        differentiators (DDs) because their derivation involved the solution of a large number of linear equations equal
        to their
        orders, and no closed form relations were available to obtain their coefficients. Furthermore, no iterative
        procedures were
        available to derive an approximation of higher order from that of a lower order, and this made it quite
        cumbersome to
        obtain the approximations of higher orders. We successfully develop the closed form expressions for forward,
        backward and
        central difference approximations of arbitrary orders in Chapter 2, giving their coefficients with explicit
        formulas. These
        formulas can not only be implemented as DDs of arbitrary orders, but also remove the need of alternate numerical
        differentiation techniques, like interpolating polynomials, operators and lozenge diagrams.<br><br>

        Implementing these formulas as DDs, as described in details in Chapter 3, gives much interesting information
        including that
        only central difference approximations can give stable type III DDs of any order, and DDs given by forward and
        backward
        difference approximations get unstable for higher orders. Moreover it is also observed that only central
        difference
        approximations based DDs have linear phase. An interesting feature observed is that these DDs based on central
        difference
        approximations are exactly the same as maximally linear DDs, although previously the formulas for the
        tap-coefficients of
        maximally linear DDs had been derived in an entirely different context. It is well-known that maximally linear
        type III DDs
        are not good in the higher frequency band and can be used only in lower band applications. We suggest a
        modification in
        their design to considerably extend their working frequency band.<br><br>

        This important relation between maximally linear DDs and the Taylor series gives us the idea that the Taylor
        series may be
        used in some other manner to derive some different approximations of derivatives, which can be implemented as
        more accurate
        and efficient DDs. Working on this possibility, we develop new finite difference approximations presented in
        Chapter 4,
        which are more accurate than the well-known ones, especially for periodic and oscillating functions having some
        components
        closer to the Nyquist frequency. These approximations are implemented as type IV maximally linear DDs, which
        prove much
        closer to the ideal, compared to type III DDs, especially in the higher frequency band. However, in a small band
        very close
        to the Nyquist frequency, these DDs also have relatively larger deviation from ideal, compared to the rest of
        the frequency
        band. We propose a modification in their design, which considerably narrows this error band.<br><br>

        In Chapter 5, we present designs of higher degree DDs, which are often needed for data analysis, but compared to
        first
        degree DDs, only a few articles can be found in literature dealing with their efficient designs. Generally an
        inefficient
        way of cascading multiple first degree DDs is used to form a higher degree DD. We use the powerful Taylor series
        to extend
        the first degree central difference and new approximations presented in Chapter 4 to higher degrees, and present
        explicit
        formulas for their coefficients. These formulas can be implemented as highly accurate and efficient DDs of
        arbitrary order
        and degree.<br><br>

        Certain relationships are available in the literature among various types of filters, which can be used to
        derive the
        design of one filter from another in a very simple way. Therefore if the explicit formulas for the
        tap-coefficients of a
        filter are known, those for many other different types of filters can be obtained in a straightforward way.
        However this
        could not be applied for maximally flat (MAXFLAT) filters, because most of the MAXFLAT designs were based on
        deriving the
        closed form expressions for frequency response and not tap-coefficients. Type III maximally linear DDs had
        explicit
        formulas for their tap-coefficients but could not be used due to their limited use for low band applications
        only. However
        our type IV DDs presented in Chapter 4 are fullband filters and we use the available and some new developed
        relationships
        and techniques to derive the design formulas of low/high pass and mid pass/stop filters in Chapter 6. <br><br>

        We continue further in Chapter 7 by deriving explicit formulas for the tap-coefficients of one band (all pass)
        filters,
        type III Hilbert transformers, type IV Hilbert transformers and differentiating Hilbert transformers. Moreover
        techniques
        are given to design band pass/stop filters and multiband filters having different magnitude characteristics in
        each
        band. <br><br>

        The MAXFLAT filters given in Chapters 6 and 7 have very smooth frequency responses, and relatively wider
        transition bands,
        which can be narrowed down only by increasing their orders. In contrast, transition bands of optimal filters can
        be
        narrowed down for a fixed order of the filter at the expense of a larger ripple on their magnitude response.
        This characteristic is very useful in practical applications for changing the transition bandwidths without
        changing the
        actual number of tap coefficients (multipliers) of the filter. We modify the presented MAXFLAT designs such that
        they
        also acquire the same property, and their transition bandwidth can be controlled with a design parameter. The
        performance
        of these modified filters is also comparable to that of optimal filters. However in terms of design complexity,
        these
        Taylor series based designs obtained with explicit formulas, are superior to optimal filters designed with
        complex
        iterative procedures.<br><br>

        All the procedures and designs presented in the thesis can be easily implemented with computer algebra programs.
        In the
        appendices, we give their implementation in MATHEMATICA, the commands of which are written like mathematical
        expressions
        and are very easy to understand. All the designs are collected in multipurpose design software developed in
        Visual C++,
        which can design single and multi band filters of any type and arbitrary order.<br><br>
