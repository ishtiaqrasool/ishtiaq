    <h1>Taylor series based designs of linear phase non-recursice
        FIR digital filters</h1>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Digital filtering, an important tool in digital signal processing (DSP), is a process to amplify, attenuate,
        isolate or manipulate certain components in the spectrum of a signal according to some desired specifications.
        The uses of digital filters are multifold, e.g., noise removal, separation of mixed signals, demodulation and
        band-limiting, etc. Various designs of digital filters are available in the literature, ranging from simple (but
        inaccurate) windows-based designs to the most sophisticated Chebyshev designs. In general, the main criterion to
        evaluate the performance of digital filters is the accuracy with which its frequency response meets the desired
        specifications. However, more emphasis is on efficiency in real-time applications, which includes the processor
        time and the required storage. Unfortunately, most of the present designs, somehow, do not meet both of these
        criteria simultaneously. My PhD research was on designing filters, more accurate than the available ones and
        efficient enough to be used in real-time systems.

    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    <p>
        A classic example of digital filtering is numerical differentiation, which uses the equally spaced input signal
        samples to evaluate its rate of change. Numerical differentiation is performed using finite difference
        approximations of the derivatives based on the Taylor series. However, these approximations could not be
        implemented
        as digital filters due to the complexity involved in their derivation for higher orders. I evaluated these
        approximations for arbitrary orders in explicit forms and found that central difference approximations are in
        fact
        the same as the type III maximally linear FIR digital differentiators. This formed the basis of a new class of
        digital filters we call Taylor filters. In this regard, the following work was done:
    </p>
 

    <ol>
        <li>I derived new highly accurate finite-difference approximations and implemented those as type IV maximally
            linear differentiators. These differentiators are more efficient than all the existing ones because their
            coefficients are expressed with explicit formulae, whereas other designs are based on iterative algorithms.
            They are also more accurate than any other design, especially at the lower frequencies. </li>

        <li>Compared to the Chebyshev design, my differentiators were extremely accurate in the narrow band for which
            they were designed. Outside this band, the Chebyshev designs, which have the same size of ripple in the
            whole spectrum, were more accurate. I modified my designs such that they became accurate at higher
            frequencies as well even very close to the Nyquist frequency. Moreover, I proposed new designs of
            differentiators of higher degrees.</li>

        <li>Going back to the mathematics domain, I converted my new designs to finite-difference formulas, which showed
            better performance than all existing numerical differentiation methods.</li>

        <li>The next breakthrough came when I discovered relationships between the impulse responses of differentiators
            and other types of filters in the spatial domain. This led to the development of new accurate and efficient
            designs of all types of filters, including low/high-pass and band-pass/stop filters, one band-filters,
            Hilbert transformers, and multi-band filters.</li>

        <li>A software was developed in Visual C++ and released for public use, which implements all the above
            designs. </li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Remarks</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Besides accuracy, my proposed designs have several desirable features. Just to give one example, existing
            lowpass MAXFLAT designs allowed only a discrete set of cutoff frequencies. My design allowed any value of
            the cutoff frequency enabling precise separation of signals even lying very close to each other in the
            spectrum.</li>

        <li>I could publish five journal papers on the designs mentioned above. My supervisor and the department were
            pleased with my performance and allowed me to defend my thesis earlier. Therefore, I could complete my PhD
            only in 2 years. Soon after, I was also awarded JSPS postdoctoral fellowship, during which I continued and
            extended this work. </li>
