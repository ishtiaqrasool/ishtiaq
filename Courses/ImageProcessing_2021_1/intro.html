    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        MATLAB Provides a few tutorials in the Help Center:<br>
        <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html">
            https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html</a><br>
        Familiarize yourself with the example given in the following sections on this website.<br>
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li> Desktop Basics <br>
            Enter statements at the command line and view results.
        </li><br>

        <li>Matrices and Arrays<br>
            MATLAB operates primarily on arrays and matrices, both in whole and in part. A matrix is a two-dimensional
            array often used for linear algebra.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Array Indexing<br>
            Variables in MATLAB are typically arrays that can hold many numbers. When you want to access selected
            elements of an array, use indexing.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Workspace Variables<br>
            The workspace contains variables that you create within or import into MATLAB from data files or other
            programs.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Calling Functions <br>
            MATLAB provides a large number of functions that perform computational tasks. To call a function, enclose
            its input arguments in parentheses.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            2-D and 3-D Plots (Learn only 2D plots for now)<br>
            Graphics functions include 2-D and 3-D plotting functions to visualize data and communicate results.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Programming and Scripts (Learn only the for and the if condition for now)<br>
            The simplest type of MATLAB program is called a script. A script contains a sequence of commands and
            function calls.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Help and Documentation (Learn how to see the help on different functions)<br>
            All functions have supporting documentation that includes examples and describes the function inputs,
            outputs, and calling syntax.
        </li><br>
    </ul>


    <p>
        The tutorials above should give you a kick start to programming in MATLAB. Learn how to look for a suitable
        function in the documentation. With this, you can solve the exercises given below.
