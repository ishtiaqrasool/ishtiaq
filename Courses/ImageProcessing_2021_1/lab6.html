    <p>
       <b>Exercise 1: Combining Spatial Enhancement Methods </b><br>
        In many cases, one transformation may not be sufficient to enhance an image. In such situations, depending on
        the nature of the original image, multiple techniques can be combined for enhancement. We will practice one such
        example in this lab.<br><br>

        In the previous lab, we learned how to enhance an image using a Laplacian filter. However, Laplacian (the second
        derivative) can produce high noise in smooth regions, which can induce noise in the enhanced image. We will see
        an example of this and find a solution in this lab.<br><br>

        Gradient (the first derivative) only enhances the edges in the image and produces less noise in the background.
        In other words, a gradient image will have high values on edges but (nearly) zero values in the background.
        Therefore, if we multiply the Laplacian image with the gradient image, we can remove (or reduce) the noise in
        the Laplacian image. However, before multiplying, it might be good to smooth the gradient with a lowpass filter.
        This improved Laplacian obtained this way can be used to enhance the image. In this exercise, we will implement
        this algorithm.<br><br>

        Do the following steps:<br><br>

        a) Read Fig.3.43(a). <br><br>
        b) Enhance the image using the Laplacian filter using the following formula, as studied in the class and the
        previous lab: B = A + k * Laplacian(A). Show the original and the enhanced image side-by-side.<br><br>
        c) You can see noise in the enhanced image caused by the Laplacian. Improve the Laplacian by multiplying
        with gradient and do the enhancement again. Show old and new results side-by-side.<br> <br>
        d) Further improve the Laplacian by multiplying with a lowpass version of the gradient. You can use a 5x5
        box kernel for lowpass filtering. Use the improved Laplacian for enhancement of the image and compare it with
        the previous results.<br><br>
        e) Further enhance the 3 enhanced versions above in (d) using Gamma correction with a suitable value of
        gamma. Compare results with the original image. For display, stretch the intensities of each image to [0, 255]
        range.


        <br><br>

        <b>Exercise 2 (Optional)(Bonus)</b><br>
        Use some other combination of image enhancing techniques you learned in this course on Fig.3.43(a). Explain the rationale of your choices.
